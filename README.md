# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Learning Management System (LMS)

## Overview
The Learning Management System (LMS) is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the management, delivery, and tracking of educational courses and training programs. The LMS will be built using Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF), providing both a web interface and a comprehensive REST API to support web and mobile clients.

---

## Objectives
- Allow instructors to create and manage courses, lessons, assignments, and assessments.
- Enable students to enroll in courses, access content, submit assignments, and track their progress.
- Provide a RESTful API for all major functionalities to support integration with external services and frontend frameworks.
- Enhance standard DRF capabilities with custom endpoints, advanced permissions, filtering, and documentation.

---

## Target Users
- **Admin:** Manages users, courses, and platform settings.
- **Instructor/Teacher:** Creates and manages courses, lessons, assignments, and assessments.
- **Student/Learner:** Enrolls in courses, accesses content, submits assignments, and tracks learning progress.

---

## Core Features

### 1. User Management
- Registration and authentication (Students, Instructors, Admin)
- User profile management
- Role-based access (Admin, Instructor, Student)
- Password reset and change

### 2. Course Management
- CRUD operations for courses (title, description, image, category, status)
- Assign instructors to courses
- Course enrollment (manual, self-enroll, invite links)
- Publish/unpublish courses

### 3. Lesson & Content Management
- Add lessons to courses (video, text, files)
- Order/sort lessons within courses
- Attach resources (PDFs, links, etc.) to lessons

### 4. Assignment & Assessment
- Create assignments and quizzes for lessons/courses
- Assignment submissions by students (file upload, text, etc.)
- Auto/manual grading
- Feedback on submissions

### 5. Enrollment & Progress Tracking
- Students enroll/unenroll in courses
- Mark lessons as completed
- Track assignment and quiz completion
- Visual dashboards for progress

### 6. Discussions & Communication
- Course-specific discussion forums (threads, replies)
- Announcements by instructors

### 7. Admin Panel
- Manage users, courses, lessons, and platform settings
- View analytics and reports

### 8. REST API (with DRF Enhancements)
- Endpoints for all above features
- JWT or token-based authentication
- Fine-grained permissions (IsOwner, IsEnrolled, IsInstructor, etc.)
- Filtering, searching, pagination on list endpoints
- Bulk actions (enroll/unenroll, grade assignments, etc.)
- API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Custom endpoints (e.g., enroll via invite, bulk grade upload, analytics)

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Responsive UI (web, with API-ready backend)
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Scalable database design
- Automated testing (unit, integration)
- Dockerized for easy deployment

---

## REST API Design (Sample Endpoints)

### User & Auth
- `POST /api/auth/register/`
- `POST /api/auth/login/`
- `GET /api/users/me/`
- `PATCH /api/users/me/`

### Courses
- `GET /api/courses/`
- `POST /api/courses/`
- `GET /api/courses/{id}/`
- `PATCH /api/courses/{id}/`
- `DELETE /api/courses/{id}/`
- `POST /api/courses/{id}/enroll/`
- `GET /api/courses/{id}/progress/`

### Lessons
- `GET /api/lessons/?course={course_id}`
- `POST /api/lessons/`
- `GET /api/lessons/{id}/`
- `PATCH /api/lessons/{id}/`
- `DELETE /api/lessons/{id}/`

### Assignments & Quizzes
- `GET /api/assignments/?course={course_id}`
- `POST /api/assignments/`
- `GET /api/assignments/{id}/`
- `POST /api/assignments/{id}/submit/`
- `POST /api/assignments/{id}/grade/`

### Discussions
- `GET /api/courses/{course_id}/discussions/`
- `POST /api/courses/{course_id}/discussions/`
- `POST /api/discussions/{id}/reply/`

### Admin/Analytics (example)
- `GET /api/admin/users/`
- `GET /api/admin/analytics/` (e.g., enrollments, completion rates)

---

## DRF Enhancements

- **Custom Permissions:** E.g., only enrolled students can access lessons, only instructors can grade.
- **Filtering/Search:** DjangoFilterBackend and custom filters on all list endpoints.
- **Bulk Operations:** Endpoints for batch enrollment, grading, etc.
- **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI with drf-yasg or similar.
- **Pagination:** Standard and custom pagination for large datasets.
- **Throttling/Rate Limiting:** Protect sensitive endpoints.
- **Versioning:** Support for future API updates.

---

## Stretch Goals

- Certificates for course completion (PDF generation)
- Payment integration for premium courses
- Real-time features (live classes via WebSockets)
- Mobile app integration

---

## Success Metrics

- Course creation, enrollment, and completion rates
- User engagement (active users, forum activity)
- Assignment submission and grading turnaround
- API usage (external integration)

---

## Milestones

1. Project setup & authentication
2. Core models (Courses, Lessons, Users)
3. Assignments, Quizzes, and Grading
4. Enrollment & Progress Tracking
5. Discussion Forums & Communication
6. REST API enhancements (permissions, docs, bulk ops)
7. Admin & Analytics
8. Testing & Deployment
